## **Project Overview**
This portfolio project creates a data warehouse using SQL Server Management Studio 21. 
The project uses the so called Medallion Architecture with Bronze, Silver and Gold layers.

1. Bronze layer: Stores the raw data from the different data sources avaliable as CSV files into an SQL data server.
2. Silver layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization and normalization to prepare the data for analysis.
3. Gold layer: Creates business ready data into star schemas that is required for analytics.

Skills used in the project
- ETL / ELT processing
- SQL Development
- Data Architecture

What is a data warehouse?
- It is a digital storing system used to extract, transform and load data from several different sources. The data can be used by the company to make business decisions.

## **Data Catalog for Gold Layer**

## Overview
The Gold Layer is the business-level data representation, structured to support analytical and reporting use cases. It consists of **dimension tables** and **fact tables** for specific business metrics.

# **Naming Conventions**

This section outlines the naming conventions used for schemas, tables, views, columns, and other objects in the data warehouse.

## **General Principles**

- **Naming Conventions**: Use snake_case, with lowercase letters and underscores (`_`) to separate words.
- **Language**: Use English for all names.
- **Avoid Reserved Words**: Do not use SQL reserved words as object names.

## **Table Naming Conventions**

### **Bronze Rules**
- All names must start with the source system name, and table names must match their original names without renaming.
- **`<sourcesystem>_<entity>`**  
  - `<sourcesystem>`: Name of the source system (e.g., `crm`, `erp`).  
  - `<entity>`: Exact table name from the source system.  
  - Example: `crm_customer_info` → Customer information from the CRM system.

### **Silver Rules**
- All names must start with the source system name, and table names must match their original names without renaming.
- **`<sourcesystem>_<entity>`**  
  - `<sourcesystem>`: Name of the source system (e.g., `crm`, `erp`).  
  - `<entity>`: Exact table name from the source system.  
  - Example: `crm_customer_info` → Customer information from the CRM system.

### **Gold Rules**
- All names must use meaningful, business-aligned names for tables, starting with the category prefix.
- **`<category>_<entity>`**  
  - `<category>`: Describes the role of the table, such as `dim` (dimension) or `fact` (fact table).  
  - `<entity>`: Descriptive name of the table, aligned with the business domain (e.g., `customers`, `products`, `sales`).  
  - Examples:
    - `dim_customers` → Dimension table for customer data.  
    - `fact_sales` → Fact table containing sales transactions.  

#### **Glossary of Category Patterns**

| Pattern     | Meaning                           | Example(s)                              |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `dim_`      | Dimension table                  | `dim_customer`, `dim_product`           |
| `fact_`     | Fact table                       | `fact_sales`                            |
| `report_`   | Report table                     | `report_customers`, `report_sales_monthly`   |

## **Column Naming Conventions**

### **Surrogate Keys**  
- All primary keys in dimension tables must use the suffix `_key`.
- **`<table_name>_key`**  
  - `<table_name>`: Refers to the name of the table or entity the key belongs to.  
  - `_key`: A suffix indicating that this column is a surrogate key.  
  - Example: `customer_key` → Surrogate key in the `dim_customers` table.
  
### **Technical Columns**
- All technical columns must start with the prefix `dwh_`, followed by a descriptive name indicating the column's purpose.
- **`dwh_<column_name>`**  
  - `dwh`: Prefix exclusively for system-generated metadata.  
  - `<column_name>`: Descriptive name indicating the column's purpose.  
  - Example: `dwh_load_date` → System-generated column used to store the date when the record was loaded.
 
## **Stored Procedure**

- All stored procedures used for loading data must follow the naming pattern:
- **`load_<layer>`**.
  
  - `<layer>`: Represents the layer being loaded, such as `bronze`, `silver`, or `gold`.
  - Example: 
    - `load_bronze` → Stored procedure for loading data into the Bronze layer.
    - `load_silver` → Stored procedure for loading data into the Silver layer.


## **Summary**
- Three folders (bronze, silver, gold) and one file to initialize a database.
- Bronze layer includes two scripts (ddl and proc load). Ddl creates schemas and proc load inserts data into schemas from external csv files. No data cleaning is done here.
- The data source files includes CRM and ERP data.
- Silver layer includes two scripts (ddl and proc load). Ddl creates schemas that fits the data structure for cleaned data. Proc load truncates, transforms and cleanes the bronze layer data and inserts it into silver schemas.
- Gold layer includes one script (ddl). Ddl creates view tables from the silver layer to produce cleaned, enriched and business ready datasets.
